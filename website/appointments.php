		<h3>House Calls &amp; In-Clinic Visits</h3>
		<p>Circle of Animals now has a permanent clinic just off of Highway 73 in the Marshdale area near North Turkey Creek Road. So now we are able to see your pet at our office or your home.</p>

	<div class="appointments-right">
		<h3>Surgery</h3>
		<p>Many types of veterinary surgeries are available. More complex procedures must be done at the clinic. Some basic ones can be done in your home. Dr. Norton will need to examine your pet and then will be able to best advise you on which location is preferable.</p>
